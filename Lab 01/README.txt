I didn't know if you could view submission history
so I did it this way. 

I was not able to sign the roll today as you were not there
and a substitute teacher was present, Bill tried to help me
with my issues but I couldn't resolve them all in time. The
substitute TA left as soon as 5:30 and I didn't have a chance
to sign roll.
